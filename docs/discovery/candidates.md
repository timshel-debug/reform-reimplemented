# Normative Candidates

This file is auto-generated by `da integrate`. Do not edit directly.

These are normative statements (MUST/SHALL/SHOULD) found in documentation
that do NOT have explicit REQ-* IDs. They need human triage to determine
if they represent actual requirements.

## Triage Instructions

1. Review each candidate below
2. Add triage decisions to docs/discovery/triage/decisions.json
3. Re-run `da integrate` to update this list
