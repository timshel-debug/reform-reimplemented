## REQ-2000 - ASM-0008 — Retention window policy (PARTIAL/TODO)

## REQ-2001 - ASM-0009 — Existing platform design identity (TODO)

Risk/Impact: if platform uses per-cart/session identifiers, decoration data modeling must change.

## REQ-2002 - OQ-0009 — Third-party legacy export API capabilities (TODO)

Risk/Impact: if third-party export is not reliable, platform must pre-cache exports earlier or enforce cutoff policy.

## REQ-2003 - DecorationRevision (immutable)

Must satisfy constraint engine at save time.

## REQ-2004 - Context

Styles/spaces are versioned; saved designs must remain compatible.
